To modify your code to drop rows with NA values in any column except K2Q32B and K2Q32C, you can use the across() function along with where() in the tidyr::drop_na() function to specify which columns to include in the NA check. Here’s how you can do it:

R
Copy code
follow_up_cleaned <- follow_up_raw |>
  select(K2Q32A, BIRTH_YR, A1_MENTHEALTH, A2_MENTHEALTH, SCREENTIME, 
         BULLIED_R, MAKEFRIEND, HOPEFUL, ACE7, ACE8, K2Q32B, K2Q32C) |> 
  drop_na(-c(K2Q32B, K2Q32C)) |> 
  mutate(
    age = 2024 - BIRTH_YR,
    parent_mental_health = rowMeans(cbind(A1_MENTHEALTH, A2_MENTHEALTH), na.rm = TRUE)
  ) |> 
  rename(
    depression = K2Q32A,
    depression_current = K2Q32B,
    depression_level = K2Q32C,
    screentime = SCREENTIME,
    bullied = BULLIED_R,
    friends = MAKEFRIEND,
    hopeful = HOPEFUL,
    violence = ACE7, 
    live_with_mental = ACE8
  ) |> 
  select(-BIRTH_YR, A1_MENTHEALTH, A2_MENTHEALTH)
Explanation:
drop_na(-c(K2Q32B, K2Q32C)): Drops rows with NA values from all columns except K2Q32B and K2Q32C. The - sign excludes these columns from the drop_na() operation.
This approach ensures that K2Q32B and K2Q32C can have NA values while all other columns will enforce non-missing data.

To ensure the x-axis in your ggplot visualization shows only integer values, you can use the scale_x_continuous() function with the breaks argument set to display integer values. Here's how you can modify your code:

R
Copy code
data_cleaned |> 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = age, fill = depression)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "Age", y = "Number of observations", fill = "Whether a Child Has Depression") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = length(unique(data_cleaned$age)))) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
Explanation:
scale_x_continuous(): Used to customize the scale of the x-axis.
The breaks argument specifies where the ticks should appear on the x-axis.
scales::pretty_breaks(n = ...): Dynamically generates integer breaks. Setting n to the number of unique ages ensures all integer values in your dataset appear on the x-axis.
theme(legend.position = "bottom"): Places the legend below the plot.
If you know the range of your age variable (e.g., from 5 to 18), you can explicitly set integer breaks like this:

R
Copy code
scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(5, 18, by = 1))
Replace 5 and 18 with the appropriate minimum and maximum values of age in your dataset.






You said:
x should be 6-17
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If the range of your x-axis should be from 6 to 17 and only integer values should appear as ticks, you can explicitly set the breaks in scale_x_continuous(). Here's the updated code:

R
Copy code
data_cleaned |> 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = age, fill = depression)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "Age", y = "Number of observations", fill = "Whether a Child Has Depression") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(6, 17, by = 1), limits = c(6, 17)) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
Explanation:
breaks = seq(6, 17, by = 1): Sets the x-axis ticks at every integer between 6 and 17.
limits = c(6, 17): Ensures the x-axis is restricted to this range, even if data extends beyond it.
This will display only the ages from 6 to 17 on the x-axis, with integer tick marks.

summarize: Parental depression shapes not only a parent’s perception of the world, but also a child’s experience of the world internally and externally, Smith says. Depressed parents have been found to interact with their children differently, in ways that affect child development. For example, Smith says, “Depressed mothers have been found in some studies to use less emotion and expressivity in their language with their babies. And they make less eye contact.”
Parental depression can impact many activities of parenting. Even a simple activity such as reading a storybook to a child may be affected. A depressed parent may not be as lively or as expressive, she says. He or she won’t change voices for different characters or make sound effects, for example. 
Of particular concern, Smith says, is isolation that may occur for parent and child, which she calls one of the “largest impacts, limiting the social networks of both the adults and the child.”
Studies link parental depression (including prenatal depression) with a wide range of difficulties, some lifelong. Depression not only interferes with parental bonding and nurturing, it also means parents may not be as likely to do the things that are necessary to keep their children safe and healthy (such as using a car seat or getting immunizations). School-age children with depressed parents may not perform as well academically, have been found in some studies to be more likely to have behavior problems, and have poorer overall health.

Parental depression can significantly impact both the parent's and the child's experiences. Depressed parents often interact with their children in ways that hinder development, such as using less emotional expression and making less eye contact. This can extend to everyday activities like reading, where a depressed parent may not engage as fully or use varied voices and sound effects. A major consequence is isolation, which limits the social networks of both parent and child. Research shows that parental depression, including during pregnancy, is linked to long-term difficulties. It impairs parental bonding and nurturing, and may lead to neglect in child safety practices, such as using car seats or getting vaccinations. School-age children of depressed parents may struggle academically, have behavior issues, and poorer health overall.

summarize What are the symptoms of parental depression?
Depression affects a parent’s mood, sleep, appetite, and energy level. Typical symptoms of depression include persistent sadness and the loss of interest in activities that used to bring pleasure, along with sleeping too little or too much, difficulty concentrating, changes in appetite (eating a lot or very little), poor energy and thoughts of suicide. Untreated depression raises the risk of substance abuse.
Signs of depression that are specifically related to parenting include:
Lack of responsiveness to a child. “Parents with depression are less likely to respond appropriately to the cues (such as crying or eye contact or gesturing) of their young children,” Smith says.
Inappropriate parenting behaviors. Some depressed parents are neglectful and disengaged from their children, while others are hyper-intrusive and over-engaged, Smith says. What these seemingly opposite behaviors have in common, she says, is the fact that neither is sensitive to a child’s cues. 
A child’s tardiness or truancy at school. Children may consistently arrive late or miss school because their parents don’t have the energy or organizational skills to get out the door on time.
How is parental depression diagnosed?
Generally speaking, doctors (including primary care doctors, ob-gyns and pediatricians) are increasingly aware of the many health risks linked to depression. Most doctors screen for it at regular appointments by looking for symptoms (such as weight gain or loss, or lethargy) and asking specific questions designed to help identify it. Some people go to the doctor on their own because they feel depressed, while others may be urged to do so by concerned friends or family members.

Parental depression can manifest through symptoms affecting mood, sleep, appetite, and energy. Common signs include persistent sadness, loss of interest in activities, sleeping too little or too much, trouble concentrating, changes in appetite, low energy, and suicidal thoughts. Untreated depression can also lead to an increased risk of substance abuse.

Symptoms specifically related to parenting include:

Lack of responsiveness: Depressed parents may not respond appropriately to their child’s cues, like crying or eye contact.
Inappropriate parenting behaviors: Depressed parents may be either neglectful and disengaged or overly intrusive, both of which fail to respond sensitively to the child’s needs.
Children’s school issues: Kids of depressed parents may be late or truant because their parents lack the energy or organizational skills to manage routines.
Diagnosis typically involves doctors screening for depression during appointments by observing symptoms and asking targeted questions. People may seek help for depression on their own or may be encouraged to do so by friends or family.

summarize Ample research has shown that the link between social skills and adolescent depression is signiﬁcant. However, how the changes in diﬀerent domains of social skills inﬂuence the change in depression from early to middle adolescence remains largely unknown. To address this gap in knowledge, the current research used longitudinal data from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (N = 1061) to examine the inﬂuences of the changes in cooperation, assertion, responsibility, and self-control on the change in depression from early to middle adolescence. Univariate latent growth modeling showed that, from early to middle adolescence, adolescents experience decreases in cooperation and assertion, increases in responsibility and depression, and stability in self-control. Multivariate latent growth modeling suggested that adolescents who had more increases in responsibility and self-control tended to experience a slower increase in depression from early to middle adolescence; while adolescents who had more decreases in cooperation and assertion tended to experience a faster increase in depression from early to middle adolescence. The results suggested that promoting adolescents social skills might be particularly salient for the prevention of adolescent depression.

Research has shown a significant link between social skills and adolescent depression, but the specific ways in which changes in different social skills influence depression from early to middle adolescence is not well understood. This study used data from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (N = 1061) to explore how changes in cooperation, assertion, responsibility, and self-control affect depression. Results from univariate latent growth modeling indicated that adolescents saw a decrease in cooperation and assertion, an increase in responsibility and depression, and stable self-control from early to middle adolescence. Multivariate latent growth modeling revealed that greater increases in responsibility and self-control were associated with a slower rise in depression, while larger decreases in cooperation and assertion were linked to a faster increase in depression. These findings highlight the importance of fostering social skills as a strategy for preventing depression in adolescents.

summarize how these three factors affecting children depression: @fig-binary1 (a) shows the relationship between depression and being bullied. The more frequently a child is bullied, the higher the probability of having depression. Approximately 5% of children who were never bullied have depression, while around 40% of children who were bullied every day experience depression. @fig-binary1 (b) illustrates the relationship between making friends and depression. Children who have more difficulty making or keeping friends have a higher proportion of depression. The difference in depression rates between children with no difficulty and those with a lot of difficulty making friends is over 25%. @fig-binary1 (c) shows how the amount of time a child spends in front of screens affects depression. The more time children spend on screens, the higher the likelihood of experiencing depression. However, the difference in having depression for this factor is not as pronounced as in the first two.

Three factors significantly impact child depression. First, the relationship between depression and being bullied is strong; children who are bullied more frequently are at a higher risk of depression. About 5% of children who were never bullied experience depression, whereas approximately 40% of those bullied daily are affected. Second, difficulty making or maintaining friendships is linked to depression, with children facing challenges in socializing showing a depression rate more than 25% higher than those without such difficulties. Finally, the amount of time spent on screens also correlates with depression, where increased screen time raises the likelihood of depression, though the effect is less pronounced than bullying or social difficulties.

what does this mean? Why does it highlight the importance of fostering social skills as a strategy for preventing depression in adolescents? A research indicated that adolescents saw a decrease in cooperation and assertion, an increase in responsibility and depression, and stable self-control from early to middle adolescence. The greater increases in responsibility and self-control were associated with a slower rise in depression, while larger decreases in cooperation and assertion were linked to a faster increase in depression.
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
This means that social skills play a critical role in how adolescents experience changes in depression as they grow. The research found that during early to middle adolescence, there was a decrease in cooperation and assertion, which are important social skills for positive interactions, and an increase in responsibility, along with stable self-control. Adolescents who showed greater improvements in responsibility and self-control were less likely to experience a rapid increase in depression, suggesting that these skills can act as protective factors.

On the other hand, larger decreases in cooperation and assertion were linked to a faster increase in depression. This implies that when adolescents become less cooperative and assertive, their ability to navigate social situations and manage relationships effectively may diminish, making them more vulnerable to depression.

The findings highlight the importance of fostering social skills such as cooperation and assertion, as well as promoting responsibility and self-control. These skills help adolescents build resilience and maintain healthy social connections, reducing their risk of depression. Encouraging these social competencies can be an effective strategy for preventing depression during the critical transition from early to middle adolescence.

in a logistic regression model, does it assume predictors are independent? If they are not independent, will some effects be duplicated?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
In a logistic regression model, independence of predictors is not an explicit assumption. However, if predictors are highly correlated (multicollinearity), it can create issues in interpreting the model results, though it does not affect the model's ability to make predictions.

Key Points:
Predictor Independence Assumption:

Logistic regression does not assume predictors are independent.
However, independence makes it easier to interpret the contribution of each predictor to the outcome.
Multicollinearity and Its Effects:

If predictors are not independent (i.e., they are correlated), multicollinearity occurs.
This can lead to:
Unstable coefficient estimates: Standard errors of the coefficients increase, making them less reliable.
Difficulty in interpreting effects: It becomes hard to determine the individual contribution of each predictor since their effects overlap.
Multicollinearity does not bias the predictions or overall fit of the model but affects inference (e.g., significance tests on coefficients).
Duplicated Effects:

Correlated predictors might appear to "duplicate" or share their effects.
For example, if two predictors (e.g., height and weight) are highly correlated, their combined effect may still be captured by the model, but their individual coefficients might be misleading or counterintuitive (e.g., one may appear non-significant or have an unexpected sign).
Addressing Multicollinearity:
Variance Inflation Factor (VIF): Use VIF to check for multicollinearity. A VIF > 10 indicates high multicollinearity.
Remove or combine predictors: Consider dropping one of the correlated predictors or combining them into a composite variable.
Regularization techniques: Use methods like Lasso or Ridge regression to handle multicollinearity by shrinking coefficients of correlated variables.
In summary, while logistic regression does not require independent predictors, dependence (multicollinearity) can complicate the interpretation of coefficients and make some effects appear duplicated or redundant.

correct my writing: Although the Screener data file includes a child-level weight and a household-level weight, this analysis does not use the weight which could make the dataset more representative. The weights uses two dimensions, the first one is by child’s race and ethnicity, the second one is by sex and age. Moreover, since the follow-up survey is quite long, some people may not have the patience to finish the survey. The weights included in the dataset also took non-response biases into account. Using methods like Post-stratification along with 2022 American Community Census Survey could make the analysis more accurate, so not adjusting using weight is a key weakness of the paper.

Another limitation is the choice of predictors. I use logistic regression with five predictors:  being bullied, difficulty making or keeping friends, living with someone with mental illness, whether the child is a victim of violence or witnessed violence in the neighbourhood, and family poverty. However, being bullied and having difficulties making friends may be highly correlated, and there might be some other correlations among the predictors. This may make some effects appear duplicated or redundant. Also, there are many variables in the dataset, and some of them might be better to be used for creating a model.

As mentioned in @sec-data, the  respondents were separated into three groups T1, T2, T3 for age 0-5, 6-11, and 12-17. However, in a small amount of rows, the age does not match with the group, so the slight inaccuracy of the dataset may cause some inaccuracy for the dataset.

Although the Screener data file includes child-level and household-level weights, this analysis does not use these weights, which could have made the dataset more representative. The weights account for two dimensions: the first is the child’s race and ethnicity, and the second is sex and age. Additionally, given the length of the follow-up survey, some respondents may not have had the patience to complete it. The weights included in the dataset also account for non-response biases. Using methods such as post-stratification with data from the 2022 American Community Survey could improve the accuracy of the analysis. Therefore, not adjusting for weights is a significant limitation of this paper.

Another limitation lies in the choice of predictors. I used logistic regression with five predictors: being bullied, difficulty making or keeping friends, living with someone with a mental illness, whether the child is a victim of violence or has witnessed violence in the neighborhood, and family poverty. However, being bullied and having difficulty making friends may be highly correlated, and other correlations might exist among the predictors. This could make some effects appear duplicated or redundant. Furthermore, while many variables are available in the dataset, some may be more suitable for creating a robust model.

As mentioned in @sec-data, respondents were divided into three groups—T1 (ages 0–5), T2 (ages 6–11), and T3 (ages 12–17). However, in a small number of cases, the recorded age does not align with the group, leading to slight inaccuracies in the dataset that may affect the analysis.

Given that children may not have enough knowledge about depression and may not know how to seek for help, it is important to explore the signs of depression and the underlying causes behind for support.

Understanding the signs of depression in children is critical, as these symptoms can manifest differently than in adults. Children may show irritability, changes in sleep or appetite, withdrawal from friends and family, or difficulty concentrating. Early recognition of these signs can make a significant difference in providing timely support.

Moreover, exploring the factors contributing to childhood depression is essential to prevention and intervention efforts. Social factors, such as bullying or difficulty making friends, can significantly impact a child’s mental health. Family dynamics, including parental depression or household instability, also play a crucial role in shaping a child’s emotional well-being. Identifying these underlying causes allows for targeted approaches to mitigate their effects.

Equally important is educating children, parents, and caregivers about depression and the available resources for help. By fostering an environment where mental health discussions are normalized, children may feel more comfortable seeking support, reducing the stigma surrounding mental health challenges.

Here’s a well-written paragraph explaining your dataset cleaning process:

The dataset was carefully cleaned and preprocessed to ensure relevance and usability for analysis. Initially, variables of interest were selected from the raw dataset, excluding irrelevant columns. Cases with FORMTYPE equal to "T1" (ages 0–5) were filtered out, as the analysis focused on children aged 6–17. Missing values were removed for most variables, except for K2Q32B and K2Q32C, which could have NA values. The age variable was computed based on the birth year, and a new variable, parent_mental_health, was derived as the average of two mental health indicators. Selected variables were then renamed for clarity and relevance. Data entries outside the target age range (6–17) were filtered out. The cleaned dataset underwent further recoding to convert categorical variables into descriptive factors with meaningful levels. For example, depression was recoded into "Yes" or "No," and other variables, such as screentime and bullied, were recoded into interpretable categories based on the original coding scheme. Finally, the data was split into training and testing sets (80%-20% split) using random sampling to facilitate subsequent model building and evaluation. This cleaning process ensured the dataset was structured, consistent, and ready for analysis.

This explanation covers each step of the cleaning process and highlights how it contributes to the overall integrity of the analysis.

simulated_data$depression <- as.factor(simulated_data$depression)
Explanation of the added variables:
depression_current: Indicates whether the child currently has depression. If depression is "Yes," there's an 80% chance of depression_current being "Yes."
depression_level: For children with depression_current = "Yes", the severity of depression is randomly assigned as "Mild," "Moderate," or "Severe" with respective probabilities of 50%, 30%, and 20%.
poverty: Simulates a poverty level between 50 and 400, with the majority of cases concentrated at 400 to reflect real-world skewness in poverty ratios.





You said:
will most of  poverty be 400?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Yes, the way the poverty variable is generated ensures that most of the values will be 400. Here's why:

r
Copy code
poverty = sample(c(50:399, rep(400, 100)), 500, replace = TRUE)
Breakdown:
The sample pool consists of:

Numbers from 50 to 399, which creates 350 unique values.
The value 400 is repeated 100 times, making it heavily overrepresented compared to the individual numbers from 50 to 399.
Since the total size of the sample pool is 
350
+
100
=
450
350+100=450, the probability of selecting 400 in each draw is approximately:

𝑃
(
400
)
=
100
450
≈
22.22
%
P(400)= 
450
100
​
 ≈22.22%
This is much higher than the probability of selecting any individual value from 50 to 399, which is approximately:

𝑃
(
any other number
)
=
1
450
≈
0.22
%
P(any other number)= 
450
1
​
 ≈0.22%
Thus, in a sample of 500, the value 400 will dominate, making it the most common poverty level in your dataset. If you need even greater concentration at 400, you can increase its repetitions in the pool (e.g., rep(400, 200)). Conversely, if you want less dominance, reduce its repetitions.

Adjustments made:
Updated the dataset name to data_cleaned to align with your new dataset.
Replaced the column names to match the critical variables in data_cleaned:
depression, depression_current, depression_level
age, parent_mental_health
screentime, bullied, friends, hopeful
violence, live_with_mental, poverty
Removed irrelevant column checks (e.g., poll_id, pollster_id, etc.) that were specific to the previous context.
This test will confirm there are no missing values in the key variables of your cleaned dataset.

how to check the type of depression?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To check the type of depression in your dataset, you can inspect its class or structure using R. Here's how you can do it:

1. Check the Class of depression:
r
Copy code
class(data_cleaned$depression)
This will tell you the data type of depression. For example, it could return "factor" or "character".

2. Check the Structure of the Column:
r
Copy code
str(data_cleaned$depression)
This command provides an overview of the variable, including its class, levels (if it's a factor), and the first few entries.

3. Check Levels if It's a Factor:
If depression is a factor, you can view the levels using:

r
Copy code
levels(data_cleaned$depression)
This will list all possible values (e.g., "Yes" and "No").

4. Check Unique Values:
If depression is not a factor but a character or numeric variable, use:

r
Copy code
unique(data_cleaned$depression)
This will show all unique values in the column.

5. Summarize the Column:
To get a quick summary of depression:

r
Copy code
summary(data_cleaned$depression)
This will show the distribution of values in depression.

Example Output:
If depression is a factor:
plaintext
Copy code
Factor w/ 2 levels "No","Yes": 1 2 1 1 2 ...
If depression is a character:
plaintext
Copy code
[1] "Yes" "No" "Yes" "No" ...
If summary(data_cleaned$depression):
plaintext
Copy code
   No   Yes 
  350   150 
This gives you the type and distribution of depression in your dataset.

can you use testthat to check if the type of depression is factor and if age, poverty, parent_mental_health are numeric
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Here’s how you can use testthat to check if the column types in your dataset meet the specified criteria:

Test Code
r
Copy code
library(testthat)

test_that("Column types are correct", {
  # Assuming `data_cleaned` is your dataset
  
  # Check if `depression` is a factor
  expect_true(is.factor(data_cleaned$depression), "The column `depression` is not a factor")
  
  # Check if `age` is numeric
  expect_true(is.numeric(data_cleaned$age), "The column `age` is not numeric")
  
  # Check if `poverty` is numeric
  expect_true(is.numeric(data_cleaned$poverty), "The column `poverty` is not numeric")
  
  # Check if `parent_mental_health` is numeric
  expect_true(is.numeric(data_cleaned$parent_mental_health), "The column `parent_mental_health` is not numeric")
})
Explanation
expect_true(is.factor(...)): Verifies that depression is a factor.
is.numeric(...): Ensures age, poverty, and parent_mental_health are numeric.
Custom error messages: Informative messages make debugging easier if the test fails.
Example Output on Test Execution
If all tests pass:

plaintext
Copy code
✔ Column types are correct
If a test fails, for instance, if depression is not a factor:

To execute the code for simulating and saving the dataset, the following R packages are required:

Required Packages
dplyr: For data manipulation functions like mutate, case_when, and select.
tibble: For creating and handling tibbles (a modern version of data frames).
arrow: For reading and writing Parquet files using write_parquet.
here: For constructing paths relative to the project root directory.
Installing the Packages
To ensure these packages are installed, use the following commands:

r
Copy code
install.packages(c("dplyr", "tibble", "arrow", "here"))
Loading the Packages
Before running the script, load the required libraries:

r
Copy code
library(dplyr)
library(tibble)
library(arrow)
library(here)
Notes
Ensure that the directory structure (data/00-simulated_data) exists or is created before running the script to avoid errors when saving the Parquet file.
If the project uses a specific environment management tool like renv, add these packages to the renv project. For example:
r
Copy code
renv::install(c("dplyr", "tibble", "arrow", "here"))

what does this question mean: What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (for example, documents, photos, people, countries)? Are there multiple types of instances (for example, movies, users, and ratings; people and interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a description
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
This question is asking for a detailed description of the individual data points or "instances" that make up the dataset. In other words, it wants you to explain what each row or observation in the dataset represents and whether there are different types of entities included. Here's what you should consider when answering this:

Nature of Instances: What do the individual observations in the dataset represent? For example:

If your dataset is about a collection of survey responses, each instance represents a single response from a respondent.
If your dataset includes social media data, each instance might represent a single post or comment.
If the dataset is medical in nature, each instance might represent a patient visit or a health record.
If it's a dataset with images, each instance could represent one image.
Multiple Types of Instances: Does the dataset include different types of observations or entities that interact with each other? For example:

In a movie recommendation system, there could be three types of instances: movies, users, and ratings (e.g., a user rates a movie).
In a social network graph, instances could be people (nodes) and their connections (edges).
In an e-commerce dataset, you might have users, products, and transactions, which are all different types of instances.
Description: Provide a summary or explanation of the dataset that includes what these instances represent and how they might relate to each other.

Example Response:
If you're working with a dataset on children’s mental health, you could answer like this:

The instances in this dataset represent individual children (each row is one child). Each child has attributes such as age, screen time, experiences of bullying, mental health status, and family circumstances. There is only one type of instance in this dataset, which is children, but the attributes capture different aspects of their experiences and conditions. There is no interaction between instances represented in this data directly, as each instance stands independently.

Or, if you have a more complex dataset:

The dataset includes two types of instances: users and movies. Each row representing a rating (the interaction between a user and a movie) has attributes such as the user ID, movie ID, and the rating score. Users and movies are different types of instances, and they are connected through the ratings they have given or received.

Every child has emotional ups and downs. However, extended periods of feeling sad or disinterest may indicate that a child is experiencing depression, a mood disorder characterized by a persistent sad or empty feeling in everyday activities. Although depression is usually not considered life-threatening, it can lead to thoughts of and attempts at suicide or self-hurt [@jhudepression]. Given that children may not have enough knowledge about depression and may not know how to seek for help, it is important to explore the signs of depression and the underlying causes behind for support.

correct my mistake only, you do not need to improve it, do not change anything in [] those are my citations: In this paper, the estimand being explored is whether a child has depression. I use a Bayesian logistic regression model, as the outcome is binary, to analyze how the following predictors affect children’s depression: being bullied, difficulty making or keeping friends, living with someone with a mental illness, whether the child is a victim of violence or has witnessed violence in the neighbourhood, and family poverty. The reason for choosing these predictors is that it is known that some children are more likely to develop anxiety or depression when they experience trauma, violence, being bullied, or when their own parents have anxiety or depression [@cdcAnxietyDepression]. The results indicate that children facing daily bullying, having a lot of difficulty making and keeping friends, living with someone who is mentally ill, suicidal, or severely depressed, and being a victim of violence or witnessing violence in their neighbourhood are more likely to have depression. Interestingly, poverty does not affect depression significantly. The model is tested and shows an accuracy of 92.33%.

Children in this paper are defined as individuals aged 0–17 years. When conducting the surveys, they were separated into three groups: T1, T2, and T3, representing the age ranges 0–5, 6–11, and 12–17, respectively (inclusive). The follow-up questionnaires have three versions, with slight differences based on the child’s age group. For example, children aged 0 to 5 were not asked questions about difficulty making friends, while children older than 5 were not asked whether they could focus on a task for at least a few minutes. Since it is unlikely for children aged 5 and under to develop depression due to external factors, this analysis focuses only on the age groups 6–11 and 12–17.

The survey selected approximately 385,000 addresses from the Census Master Address File to identify households with children under 18 years old. State-level samples were designed to produce roughly equal numbers of completed questionnaires across states and the District of Columbia [@NSCHDocumentation].

A screener questionnaire was sent to the sampled households to confirm occupancy and the presence of eligible children aged 0–17. It included demographic questions and a series of health questions used to determine whether each eligible child could be classified as having a special health care need. For households with eligible children, one child was subsampled as the subject of the topical questionnaire, which is the follow-up survey. This follow-up asked about access to and quality of health care, family interactions, parental health, school and after-school experiences, and neighbourhood characteristics. Subsampling prioritized children with special health care needs (oversampled at 80%) and children aged 0–5 (oversampled at 60%) to address their underrepresentation in surveys and administrative records. This design supported robust representation of children and enabled reliable multi-year trend analyses [@NSCHDocumentation].

61% of respondents were mothers, and 29% were fathers (biological, step, foster, or adoptive). Six percent were other relatives or caregivers. The weighted Screener Completion Rate was 41.9%, and the weighted Topical Completion Rate was 27.1% [@NSCHDocumentation].

Selected households were mailed instructions to complete the 2023 NSCH, with the option to respond in English or Spanish. Non-responding households received follow-up mailings as reminders. To complete the survey online, households received invitation letters with instructions for accessing the web instrument. Respondents first completed the screener, which determined eligibility and directed them to the topical questionnaires. The subsampling occurred immediately after the screener. For paper completion, households received a self-administered paper-and-pencil screener, which was returned by mail. If eligible children were identified, a topical questionnaire was sent to the same household for completion and return. Thirty percent of the sample most likely to respond by paper received the paper questionnaire in the initial mailing. Paper questionnaires were also included in the third and fourth follow-up mailings for addresses requiring at least two follow-ups. The 2023 NSCH implemented unconditional incentives for 90% of the sample, offering a $5 cash incentive in the initial mailing to boost response rates. A control group of 10% of the sample received no cash incentive to assess the impact of the incentive on response rates [@NSCHDocumentation].

@fig-age illustrates the distribution of children with and without depression across different ages. Both the number of children and the proportion of those experiencing depression increase as age increases. The proportion of depression among children under 10 is very small, whereas the proportion among teenagers is significantly higher.

@fig-level shows the proportion of different depression severity levels among children currently experiencing depression. The severity of depression increases with age. Approximately 60% of children younger than 12 have mild depression, whereas only half of teenagers have mild depression. For children aged 13 and older, the proportion experiencing severe depression is much higher than that of children aged 10 and younger.

@fig-binary1 (a) shows the relationship between depression and being bullied. The more frequently a child is bullied, the higher the probability of having depression. Approximately 5% of children who were never bullied have depression, while around 40% of children who were bullied every day experience depression. @fig-binary1 (b) illustrates the relationship between making friends and depression. Children who have more difficulty making or keeping friends have a higher proportion of depression. The difference in depression rates between children with no difficulty and those with a lot of difficulty making friends is over 25%. @fig-binary1 (c) shows how the amount of time a child spends in front of screens affects depression. The more time children spend on screens, the higher the likelihood of experiencing depression. However, the difference in having depression for this factor is not as pronounced as in the first two.

@fig-binary2 (a) shows the relationship between depression and living with people who have mental illness. Only around 5% of children who do not live with someone who is mentally ill, suicidal, or severely depressed have depression, while 25% of those who live with individuals experiencing mental illness have depression. Children from families that remain hopeful even during difficult times have the lowest likelihood of experiencing depression, as indicated in @fig-binary2 (b). Conversely, children from families that sometimes remain hopeful have the highest likelihood of depression. The proportion of children with depression in families that never or mostly remain hopeful is similar. The difference in this variable is not that large. In @fig-binary2 (c), if a child has either been a victim of violence or witnessed violence in the neighbourhood, the probability of depression is approximately 15% higher compared to children who have never experienced violence.

The family poverty ratio is calculated as the ratio of total family income to the family poverty threshold and reported as a rounded percentage ranging from 50 to 400. Values beyond this range are reported at 50 or 400, respectively. As shown in @fig-poverty, overall, the wealthier the family, the less likely a child is to experience depression. The highest proportion of depression occurs when the family poverty ratio is between 200 and 225, while the lowest proportion is seen when the ratio exceeds 375, the wealthiest range. Another local peak in depression is observed at a ratio between 250 and 275, with a local minimum occurring at a poverty ratio between 200 and 225.

Therefore, the predictors I have chosen include being bullied, difficulty making or keeping friends, living with someone with a mental illness, being a victim of violence or witnessing violence in the neighbourhood, and family poverty. Screen time and hopefulness will not be included in the model, as their impacts are less significant.

Certainly! Here is the revised version:

@fig-age illustrates the distribution of children with and without depression across different ages. Both the number of children and the proportion experiencing depression increase with age. The proportion of children with depression is very small under age 10, whereas it is significantly higher among teenagers.

@fig-level shows the proportion of different depression severity levels among children currently experiencing depression. The severity of depression increases with age. Approximately 60% of children younger than 12 have mild depression, while only half of teenagers have mild depression. For children aged 13 and older, the proportion experiencing severe depression is much higher than that of children aged 10 and younger.

@fig-binary1 (a) shows the relationship between depression and being bullied. The more frequently a child is bullied, the higher the probability of having depression. Approximately 5% of children who were never bullied have depression, compared to around 40% of children who are bullied daily. @fig-binary1 (b) illustrates the relationship between making friends and depression. Children who struggle more with making or keeping friends have a higher proportion of depression. The depression rate difference between children who have no difficulty and those who face significant difficulty making friends exceeds 25%. @fig-binary1 (c) shows how the amount of time a child spends in front of screens affects depression. The more time children spend on screens, the higher the likelihood of depression. However, the difference in depression rates for this factor is not as pronounced as for the first two.

@fig-binary2 (a) shows the relationship between depression and living with people who have mental illness. Only around 5% of children who do not live with someone who is mentally ill, suicidal, or severely depressed have depression, while 25% of those who live with individuals experiencing mental illness have depression. Children from families that remain hopeful, even during difficult times, have the lowest likelihood of depression, as shown in @fig-binary2 (b). Conversely, children from families that sometimes remain hopeful have the highest likelihood of depression. The proportion of children with depression in families that either never or mostly remain hopeful is similar. In @fig-binary2 (c), children who have been victims of violence or have witnessed violence in their neighbourhoods have a probability of depression that is approximately 15% higher than those who have never experienced violence.

The family poverty ratio is calculated as the ratio of total family income to the family poverty threshold and reported as a rounded percentage ranging from 50 to 400. Values beyond this range are reported at 50 or 400, respectively. As shown in @fig-poverty, overall, the wealthier the family, the less likely a child is to experience depression. The highest proportion of depression is seen when the family poverty ratio ranges between 200 and 225, while the lowest proportion is observed when it exceeds 375, representing the wealthiest range. A second local peak in depression occurs at a ratio between 250 and 275, with a local minimum at a ratio between 200 and 225.

Therefore, the predictors I have chosen include being bullied, difficulty making or keeping friends, living with someone with a mental illness, being a victim of violence or witnessing violence in the neighbourhood, and family poverty. Screen time and hopefulness will be excluded from the model due to their less significant impacts.

As shown in @sec-data, differences in these five predictors are associated with depression, so these were chosen as the predictors. Being bullied can lead to emotional distress, low self-esteem, and social isolation, and difficulty making or keeping friends may impact a child's sense of belonging and emotional security,  all of which can contribute to depression and other mental health challenges. Living with someone with a mental illness can create a stressful environment that affects the child’s emotional well-being, as they may experience increased anxiety and uncertainty. Whether a child is a victim of violence or witnesses violence in their neighbourhood can contribute to trauma, fear, and heightened stress. Family poverty can influence mental health by limiting access to resources or increasing stress levels within the household. Together, these factors may have a profound impact on children’s mental health and well-being.

I expect to observe both being bullied and having difficulty making or keeping friends are associated with a higher risk of depression, as shown in @fig-binary1. Additionally, both living with someone with a mental illness and being a victim of violence are likely to correlate with an increased risk of depression, as reflected in @fig-binary2. According to @fig-poverty, higher levels of family poverty are also expected to be linked to an increased likelihood of depression.

The topical dataset includes a total of 457 variables, containing a wide range of demographic information and health-related questions, such as whether the child has Autism or has been treated unfairly due to race or health conditions.

It is known that some children are more likely to develop anxiety or depression when they experience the following: trauma or stress; violence, abuse, or neglect; being bullied or rejected by other children; or when their own parents have anxiety or depression [@cdcAnxietyDepression]. Therefore, to explore childhood depression, I selected two variables related to family mental health (when their own parents have anxiety or depression), three related to social life (being bullied or rejected by other children), one related to past experiences (violence and trauma), and one pertaining to poverty, aiming to represent various aspects of children’s living conditions and potential external factors using a small number of variables. It is possible that some omitted variables not included in the analysis might have provided stronger relationships, making the current model less comprehensive than it could be. However, many of them are correlated, which can lead to redundancy in the model. To avoid overfitting and over-complication, I chose five out of seven factors as predictors that best represent different aspects of children’s life conditions, focusing on those with the most significant potential impact on depression. The accuracy of model on testing data will be shown in @sec-results.

Since the outcome is binary, logistic regression is the most appropriate model to use. However, if the survey were to provide a numeric measure of the severity of children’s depression, alternative models, such as linear regression, could be considered.

In @tbl-model, the coefficient for being bullied increases with frequency, indicating that the more often a child is bullied, the higher their likelihood of experiencing depression. The coefficient for being bullied almost every day is 1.339, while the coefficient for never being bullied is 0. For difficulty making or keeping friends, a child with a lot of difficulty has a coefficient of 1.838, while a child with a little difficulty has a coefficient of 1.136, and no difficulty has a coefficient of 0. This illustrates that the more difficulty a child has in making or keeping friends, the more likely they are to develop depression. The coefficient for not living with someone with a mental illness is -1.242, while living with someone with a mental illness has a coefficient of 0, suggesting that living with a person with a mental illness is associated with a higher likelihood of depression. For being a victim or witness of violence, the coefficient is 0.823, while not being a victim has a coefficient of 0, showing that experiencing or witnessing violence increases the risk of depression in children. The poverty coefficient is 0, suggesting that family poverty may not have a significant impact on children’s depression in this model.

Overall, children who are bullied almost every day, have significant difficulty making friends, live with someone with a mental illness, and have experienced violence are the most likely to suffer from depression. Conversely, children who are not bullied, do not have difficulty making friends, do not live with a mentally ill person, and have not experienced violence are the least likely to have depression.

The model was trained using an 80% training set and evaluated on a 20% testing set, achieving a 92.33% accuracy rate. This high level of accuracy demonstrates the model's effectiveness in predicting childhood depression.

As shown in both @sec-data and @results, the impacts of family is important for children depression. Additionally, @fig-parents shows the relationship between parents mental health and children depression rate, and the more mentally healthy of parents, the less likely for children to get depressed. The disparity might get even larger as sometimes people think they are mentally healthier than they actually do. 

Parental depression can significantly impact child’s experiences. Depressed parents often interact with their children in ways that hinder development, such as using less emotional expression and making less eye contact. This can extend to everyday activities, causing a sense of isolation and then limiting the social networks of the child. Research shows that parental depression, including during pregnancy, is linked to long-term difficulties. It impairs parental bonding and nurturing, and may lead to neglect in child safety practices, such as using car seats or getting vaccinations. School-age children of depressed parents may struggle academically, have behaviour issues, and poorer health overall [@yaleparental]. 

Some symptoms of parental depression include the include a lack of responsiveness, where depressed parents may not respond appropriately to their child’s cues, such as crying or eye contact. Depressed parents may also display inappropriate parenting behaviours, ranging from neglectful and disengaged to overly intrusive, with both extremes failing to respond sensitively to the child’s needs. Additionally, children of depressed parents may experience school-related issues, such as consistent tardiness, as their parents may lack the energy or organizational skills necessary to manage routines effectively [@yaleparental].

correct my writing and improve my title : Social Skills and Adolescent
@fig-binary1 shows children who are bullied more frequently and have difficulty making or maintaining friendships are at a higher risk of depression. The amount of time spent on screens also correlates with depression, where increased screen time raises the likelihood of depression, though the effect is less pronounced than bullying or social difficulties.

A research found that during early to middle adolescence, there was a decrease in cooperation and assertion, which are important social skills for positive interactions, and an increase in responsibility, along with stable self-control. Adolescents who showed greater improvements in responsibility and self-control were less likely to experience a rapid increase in depression, suggesting that these skills can act as protective factors. Moreover, larger decreases in cooperation and assertion were linked to a faster increase in depression. This implies that when adolescents become less cooperative and assertive, their ability to navigate social situations and manage relationships effectively may diminish, making them more vulnerable to depression [@nihLongitudinal]. This demonstrates the importance of fostering social skills as a strategy for preventing depression in adolescents, and explains why being bullied and having difficulties to make friends increase the likelihood of having depression.

Additionally, the amount of time spent on screens correlates with depression, with increased screen time raising the likelihood of depression, although the effect is less pronounced than that of bullying or social difficulties.

Research has found that during early to middle adolescence, there is a decline in cooperation and assertion—key social skills for positive interactions—while responsibility increases and self-control remains stable. Adolescents who showed greater improvements in responsibility and self-control were less likely to experience a rapid increase in depression, suggesting that these skills can serve as protective factors. Conversely, larger decreases in cooperation and assertion were linked to a faster increase in depression. This implies that as adolescents become less cooperative and assertive, their ability to navigate social situations and manage relationships effectively may diminish, making them more vulnerable to depression [@nihLongitudinal]. These findings highlight the importance of fostering social skills as a preventive strategy against depression in adolescents, and help explain why being bullied and experiencing difficulty making friends increase the likelihood of depression.

Diagnose and Treatment
There are no laboratory tests for diagnosing depression, making mental health evaluations crucial. Consulting a child’s paediatrician can be an important first step toward obtaining a depression diagnosis. Common symptoms of depression in children include loss of interest and appetite, persistent sadness, trouble sleeping, and changes in behaviour.

In severe cases, depression may lead a teen or child to consider suicide. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, suicide is the second leading cause of death for children between the ages of 10 and 14, and the third leading cause of death in children ages 15–18 [cdcAnxietyDepression]. 

Similar to how depression differs among individuals, treatment approaches also vary. For mild cases, therapy can be as effective as medication. In moderate or severe cases, psychotherapy may be combined with medication. Antidepressants, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, are often considered first-line treatment options [@jhudepression].

Consulting a child’s pediatrician can be an important first step in identifying depression. Common symptoms of depression in children include loss of interest and appetite, persistent sadness, trouble sleeping, and changes in behavior.

In severe cases, depression can lead children and teens to contemplate suicide.

Treatment approaches for depression vary, reflecting the unique nature of the condition among individuals. For mild cases, therapy alone can be as effective as medication. In moderate to severe cases, psychotherapy may be combined with medication. Antidepressants, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), are often considered first-line treatment options [@jhudepression].

Although the Screener data file includes child-level and household-level weights, this analysis does not use these weights, which could have made the dataset more representative. The weights account for two dimensions: the first is the child’s race and ethnicity, and the second is sex and age. Additionally, given the length of the follow-up survey, some respondents may not have had the patience to complete it. The weights included in the dataset also account for non-response biases. Using methods such as post-stratification with data from the 2022 American Community Survey could improve the accuracy of the analysis. Therefore, not adjusting for weights is a significant limitation of this paper.

Another limitation lies in the choice of predictors. I used logistic regression with five predictors: being bullied, difficulty making or keeping friends, living with someone with a mental illness, whether the child is a victim of violence or has witnessed violence in the neighbourhood, and family poverty. However, being bullied and having difficulty making friends may be highly correlated, and other correlations might exist among the predictors. This could make some effects appear duplicated or redundant. Furthermore, while many variables are available in the dataset, some may be more suitable for creating a robust model.

@sec-results indicates that poverty, with a coefficient of 0, does not appear to affect the probability of having depression. However, this may be due to most families in the dataset having a poverty ratio at 400, which reduces variability and may lead to inaccuracies in the analysis.

As mentioned in @sec-data, respondents were divided into three groups—T1 (ages 0–5), T2 (ages 6–11), and T3 (ages 12–17). However, in a small number of cases, the recorded age does not align with the group. The slight inaccuracies in the dataset may affect the analysis to some extent.

Revised Analysis Limitations

One significant limitation of this study is the exclusion of child-level and household-level weights, which could have enhanced the representativeness of the dataset. These weights are designed to account for variations in the child’s race and ethnicity, as well as sex and age. Additionally, the weights help address non-response biases, which can skew results, especially given the potential for respondents to become disengaged due to the length of the follow-up survey. Employing techniques such as post-stratification with data from the 2022 American Community Survey could have improved the analysis' accuracy. The absence of these adjustments is an important limitation of this study.

Another limitation involves the selection of predictors. This analysis utilized a logistic regression model with five predictors: being bullied, difficulty making or keeping friends, living with someone with a mental illness, being a victim or witness to violence, and family poverty. However, predictors such as being bullied and having difficulty making friends may be highly correlated, potentially leading to redundancy and duplicative effects. Additionally, while a wide range of variables are available in the dataset, some variables might have provided stronger insights and led to a more comprehensive model.

As indicated in @sec-results, the coefficient for poverty is 0, suggesting that it does not appear to affect the likelihood of depression. However, this finding may be influenced by the high proportion of families in the dataset with a poverty ratio at 400, which reduces variability and could lead to inaccuracies in the analysis.

Lastly, as noted in @sec-data, respondents were divided into age groups T1 (ages 0–5), T2 (ages 6–11), and T3 (ages 12–17). However, there are a small number of cases where the recorded age does not align with these age groups. Although these inaccuracies are minor, they could still affect the analysis to some degree.
