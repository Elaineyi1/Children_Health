# Children's Depression in the USA
## Overview
This paper uses a Bayesian logical regression model to analyze whether a child has depression using the predictors: being bullied, difficulty making or keeping friends, living with someone with mental illness, whether the child is a victim of violence or witnessed violence in the neighbourhood, and family poverty. The results indicate that children facing daily bullying, having a lot of difficulty making and keeping friends, living with someone who is mentally ill, suicidal, or severely depressed, and being a victim of violence or witnessing violence in their neighbourhood are more likely to have depression. 

The dataset used is the 2023 National Survey of Childrenâ€™s Health. The raw data was not uploaded because of the size of the dataset.

-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download, clean, test the data, and the script used to create and test the model.
-   `model` contains the model generated.
-   `other` contains the sketches, llm usage, and a datasheet.
-   `data` contains the simulated and cleaned datasets used to analyze children depression.
